# Trashnet_NSFW Dataset

This dataset is inspired by [Trashnet](https://github.com/garythung/trashnet).

In a nutshell, our dataset is collected from 3 main sources 
- [Trashnet](https://github.com/garythung/trashnet) dataset
- [this GitHub](https://github.com/deepak2233/Waste-or-Garbage-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning/tree/main)
- NSFW Team images: collect by us

This dataset includes 4658 images in seven classes: 
- cardboard, 
- compost, 
- metal, 
- paper, 
- plastic, 
- glass, 
- trash.

For further statistics, please read [Final_Report.pdf](https://github.com/uyenbhku/CS114.N21/blob/main/Final_Project/Final_Report.pdf). At the moment, we only support Vietnamese. 

For processed images (resized) only, it is stored in [trashnet_NSFW_v3.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jGfqzsHyMTChhp9eMlaOBzCdyCNO87bo/view?usp=drive_link)

We also provide another dataset, which includes augmented images and is split and stored in the file zip in Google Drive [splits_v3.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qHL9NaEADU3fLY9jvxopnXk8vbA7vVFu/view?usp=drive_link)
